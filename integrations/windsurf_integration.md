## 1. Introducing FLUX.1 Kontext

FLUX.1 Kontext is a professional **image-to-image editing model** developed by Black Forest Labs, designed for **intelligent contextual understanding** and **precise image manipulation**. It supports a wide range of editing tasks without requiring complex prompts, including object modification, style transformation, background replacement, character consistency editing, and text editing.

FLUX.1 Kontext's core strengths lie in its **exceptional contextual understanding and ability to maintain character consistency**. It ensures that key elementsâ€”such as character features and compositional layoutsâ€”remain stable even after multiple rounds of editing.

Additionally, both the **FLUX.1 Kontext Pro** and **FLUX.1 Kontext Max** versions of the API are now available as paid offerings. Black Forest Labs says it will soon release the open source FLUX.1 Kontext Dev.

- **FLUX.1 Kontext Pro**: Ideal for editing, compositing, and creative regeneration.
- **FLUX.1 Kontext Max**: Optimized for advanced typography, prompt precision, and editing speed.
- **FLUX.1 Kontext Dev**: Coming soon.

## 2. Introducing WaveSpeed MCP: Empowering Agent Multimodality

WaveSpeedAI is a global leading platform in multimodal AI acceleration, **integrating the most advanced AI video and image generation models**. We provide efficient, secure, and reliable solutions, empowering developers and enterprises to accelerate creation and commercialization.

### Seamless Integration, Enhanced Agent Capabilities

## 3. Introducing Windsurf

**Windsurf** is a new AI programming assistant developed by the Codeium team, designed to enhance developers' productivity through deep integration with AI technologies. It excels in contextual understanding, toolchain integration, and intelligent code assistance, while also offering a wide range of features and flexible collaboration modes. Like Cursor, Windsurf provides access to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models â€” completely free to use.

However, **Windsurf still has some limitations**. For example, during development, if you want it to fetch a website's logo, generate a product promo video, or connect directly to a database to retrieve user dataâ€”tasks that involve multimodal processing or real-world executionâ€”Windsurf often falls short.

This is exactly where **MCP** makes a difference. It extends Windsurf's capabilities beyond reasoning, enabling it to act. With MCP, Windsurf evolves from a tool that can "think" to one that can also "do," becoming a truly unified AI assistant that helps developers complete the full loop from intelligent inference to real-world execution.
