# FLUX.1 Kontext MCP Launches Globally: Unlock Real-Time Multimodal Agent Power with One Click

## 1. Introducing FLUX.1 Kontext

FLUX.1 Kontext is a professional **image-to-image editing model** developed by Black Forest Labs, designed for **intelligent contextual understanding** and **precise image manipulation**. It supports a wide range of editing tasks without requiring complex prompts, including object modification, style transformation, background replacement, character consistency editing, and text editing.

FLUX.1 Kontext's core strengths lie in its **exceptional contextual understanding and ability to maintain character consistency**. It ensures that key elementsâ€”such as character features and compositional layoutsâ€”remain stable even after multiple rounds of editing.

Additionally, both the **FLUX.1 Kontext Pro** and **FLUX.1 Kontext Max** versions of the API are now available as paid offerings. Black Forest Labs says it will soon release the open source FLUX.1 Kontext Dev.

- **FLUX.1 Kontext Pro**: Ideal for editing, compositing, and creative regeneration.
- **FLUX.1 Kontext Max**: Optimized for advanced typography, prompt precision, and editing speed.
- **FLUX.1 Kontext Dev**: Coming soon.

## 3. Introducing TRAE by ByteDance

**TRAE** is an AI-native integrated development environment (AI IDE) developed by ByteDance. It supports AI-driven Q&A, code autocompletion, and agent-based AI programming, offering developers an intelligent and efficient coding experience.

However, **TRAE still has some limitations**. For example, during development, if you want it to fetch a website's logo, generate a product promo video, or connect directly to a database to retrieve user dataâ€”tasks that involve multimodal processing or real-world executionâ€”TRAE often falls short.

This is exactly where **MCP** makes a difference. It extends TRAE's capabilities beyond reasoning, enabling it to act. With MCP, TRAE evolves from a tool that can "think" to one that can also "do," becoming a truly unified AI assistant that helps developers complete the full loop from intelligent inference to real-world execution.

## 4. Integrating WaveSpeed MCP into TRAE
